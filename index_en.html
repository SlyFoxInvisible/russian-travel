            According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
            but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country.
            Like, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole
            universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the
            Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the plateau Putorana. And you
            can also see all these beauties without millions on your account, a
            foreign passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Faith
            Bashmakova is a brave young mother who took three children in her
            arms, put them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across
            her native country. We have selected and described some interesting
            places worthy of your vacation.

                water horizons — the calm Curonian Lagoon on one side and the
                rippling waves of the Baltic Sea on the other. A unique natural

                seaside towns. The atmosphere of these places eliminates the
                hustle and bustle, plunging into the tranquility of nature and

                Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of
                all , because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you
                will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and
                lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get
                acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places — the
                mountain air.
              </p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">
                The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in
                summer. So you will see all the variety of local flora and
                fauna. Through the woods Moose roam the Altai, eagles fly over
                the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous
                manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

                Everyone knows Lake Baikal as the largest lake in the world.
                Many people also know that this is the largest source of fresh
                water and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.

                Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
                for skioring competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier
                ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as
                much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019 , a world
                record was set at the Baikal Mile Festival — 197.011 km/h.

                stretches for 30 meters — the forests of Karelian national parks

                ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is
